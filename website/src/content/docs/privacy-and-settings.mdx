## Privacy First

Superclip is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local-only storage** — all clipboard data stays on your Mac. Nothing is sent to any server.
- **No analytics** — Superclip doesn't collect usage data, track behavior, or phone home.
- **No cloud sync** — your clipboard history never leaves your device.
- **No account required** — no sign-up, no login, no personal data collected.

## App Exclusions

You can exclude specific apps from clipboard monitoring. When an excluded app is in the foreground, Superclip won't capture anything you copy.

This is useful for:

- **Password managers** (1Password, Bitwarden) — prevent passwords from appearing in history
- **Banking apps** — keep sensitive financial data out of your clipboard
- **Any app** with sensitive content you don't want recorded

To configure exclusions, open **Settings** > **Excluded Apps** and add the apps you want to skip.

## Auto-Clear on Quit

Enable **Clear history on quit** in Settings to automatically erase your clipboard history every time you close Superclip. This is ideal if you share your Mac or want a clean slate each session.

Pinned items are **not** affected by auto-clear — they persist regardless of this setting.

## History Limits

Superclip stores up to **100 items** in clipboard history. You can adjust this limit in Settings if you want fewer items retained.

## Settings Access

Open Settings from:

- The **menu bar icon** > Settings
- The **gear icon** in the Superclip drawer
- Keyboard: open the drawer and click the settings gear
