# Superclip Marketing Plan (Zero Ad Spend)

## High-Impact — Do Now

### 1. Reddit & Hacker News Launches

Post to r/macapps, r/productivity, r/apple, and Show HN. The "free for first 1,000 users" angle creates urgency. Write it as a founder story, not an ad. Link to the "Why We Built Superclip" blog post.

### 2. Product Hunt Launch

Coordinate a single-day launch. The free tier + CleanShot X replacement angle is strong. Prep screenshots, a short demo GIF, and a maker comment. Thursday or Tuesday launches tend to do best.

### 3. YouTube / Blog Outreach

Find Mac productivity YouTubers and bloggers who've reviewed Paste or CleanShot X. Email them a free license and a one-paragraph pitch. They're already covering the category — you just need to be in the comparison.

### 4. SEO Content (Already In Progress)

7 blog posts are live targeting good keywords. Next high-value posts:

- "Paste Stack: What It Is and Why You Need It" (new category term = own it)
- "Free CleanShot X Alternatives for Mac" (listicle, rank for the long tail)
- "How to Manage Clipboard History on Mac" (beginner funnel)

## Medium-Effort — Compounds Over Time

### 5. Twitter/X and Mastodon Build-in-Public

Post weekly dev updates, screenshots, GIFs of features. Tag #buildinpublic, #indiedev, #macdev. The Mac dev community is tight-knit and shares generously.

### 6. Mac Developer Communities

Post in the MacAdmins Slack, Swift forums, Indie Dev Monday newsletter submissions, and macOS-focused Discord servers. Developers are early adopters and refer tools to each other.

### 7. GitHub Presence

Open-source a small utility from Superclip (an OCR Swift package, a paste-stack helper, etc.). Link back to the main app. Developers discover tools through GitHub.

### 8. Comparison & Alternative Directories

Submit Superclip to AlternativeTo.net (as an alternative to Paste, CleanShot X, Maccy), Slant, and SaaSHub. These rank well in Google for "X alternative" searches.

## Leverage What's Already Built

### 9. Free Spots Counter

The site already shows "743 of 1,000 spots remaining." Share milestones publicly: "500 spots left," "200 spots left." Scarcity drives action and is inherently shareable.

### 10. Referral Loop

Add a "Share Superclip" option in the app itself — a simple link-copy button. Users who got it free are motivated to tell friends before spots run out.

### 11. llms.txt

Already deployed at /public/llms.txt. When people ask AI assistants for clipboard manager recommendations, structured data increases the odds of being mentioned.

## Priority Order

1. Reddit + Hacker News (immediate traffic, validates messaging)
2. Product Hunt (single coordinated launch day)
3. YouTube/blog outreach (ongoing, snowballs with SEO)
4. More blog posts (compound organic traffic)
5. Build-in-public social (ongoing brand building)
6. Directory submissions (set-and-forget backlinks)
7. Referral loop in-app (multiplier on all of the above)
