# Superclip

> The clipboard manager macOS deserves.

Superclip is a native macOS clipboard manager built with SwiftUI. It is a commercial alternative to Paste that offers the same features at half the price, plus built-in screen capture and recording.

## What is Superclip?

Superclip is a menu-bar clipboard manager for macOS that provides:

- **Clipboard history**: Automatically saves everything you copy. Search, preview, and re-paste from your full history.
- **Smart pinboards**: Organize frequently used snippets into color-coded collections.
- **Paste stack**: Copy multiple items, then paste them sequentially — a game-changing workflow for moving data between apps.
- **Built-in OCR**: Extract text from any image or screenshot on your clipboard.
- **Screen capture and recording** (coming February 2026): Screenshots, GIF recording, MP4 recording, scrolling capture, and a full image and video editor. Replaces CleanShot X ($99/yr) at no extra cost.
- **iOS companion app** (coming March 2026): Sync your clipboard across Mac and iPhone.
- **Keyboard-first design**: Global hotkeys for everything. ⌘⇧A to open history, ⌘⇧C for paste stack, Space to preview, and more.
- **Privacy-focused**: All data stays local on your Mac. No cloud sync, no analytics, no tracking. Exclude sensitive apps and auto-clear history on quit.

## Pricing

- **Free** for the first 1,000 users — forever. No trial, no credit card.
- After free spots are claimed: **$14.99/year** or **$1.99/month**.
- Paste charges $29.99/year. Superclip is 50% cheaper with the same features plus screen capture.
