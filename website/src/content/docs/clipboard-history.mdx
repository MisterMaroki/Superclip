## How It Works

Superclip monitors your system clipboard every 0.5 seconds. When it detects new content, it's automatically saved to your history. No manual action required — just copy as you normally would.

## Supported Content Types

Superclip detects and stores several content types, checked in this order:

1. **Images** — screenshots, copied images, image data
2. **Files** — copied files and folders (single-image files are treated as images)
3. **URLs** — web links with automatic metadata fetching (title, description, favicon)
4. **Plain text** — any text content, including code snippets, numbers, and more

Rich text (RTF) formatting is also preserved when available.

## History Limits

Superclip keeps up to **100 items** in your clipboard history. When the limit is reached, the oldest item is removed to make room for new ones.

## Deduplication

If you copy the same content twice, Superclip won't create a duplicate entry. Instead, the existing item is moved to the top of your history.

## Source App Tracking

Each clipboard item shows which app it was copied from. This makes it easy to identify items when your history is full of similar-looking text snippets.

## Search

With the drawer open, start typing to filter your history. Search matches against the text content of your items. Press `Esc` to clear the search.

## Managing Items

- **Delete** — select an item and press `Backspace` or `Delete`
- **Undo delete** — press `Cmd+Z` within ~30 seconds to restore a deleted item
- **Copy** — press `Enter` or click to copy an item back to your clipboard

## Link Previews

When you copy a URL, Superclip automatically fetches the page title, description, and favicon. This makes links easy to identify in your history without having to remember bare URLs.
