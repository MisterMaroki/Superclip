## Download Superclip

Superclip is available as a direct download from the [Superclip website](https://superclip.app/#download). It requires **macOS 12 (Monterey)** or later and runs natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

1. Visit [superclip.app](https://superclip.app/#download) and click **Download Free**
2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
3. Drag **Superclip** into your **Applications** folder
4. Launch Superclip from Applications or Spotlight

## Grant Accessibility Permissions

Superclip needs Accessibility access to monitor global keyboard shortcuts and simulate paste actions. On first launch, you'll be prompted to grant this permission.

1. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility**
2. Click the lock icon to make changes
3. Toggle **Superclip** on in the list
4. If Superclip isn't listed, click the **+** button and select it from Applications

> If you skip this step, global hotkeys like `Cmd+Shift+A` won't work. You can always grant access later from System Settings.

## Menu Bar Icon

Superclip runs as a **menu bar app** — it won't appear in your Dock. After launching, you'll see the Superclip icon in your menu bar at the top of the screen.

Click the menu bar icon or press `Cmd+Shift+A` to open the clipboard history drawer.

## First Launch

On your first launch, Superclip will walk you through a brief onboarding:

- **Accessibility permissions** — required for global hotkeys
- **Quick intro** — overview of key features
- **You're ready** — start copying and pasting

Superclip automatically starts monitoring your clipboard after setup. Everything you copy will appear in your history.
