## What Are Snippets?

Snippets let you define trigger shortcuts that expand into full text. Type a short trigger like `;;email` in any app and Superclip replaces it with the expanded text you configured.

## Creating a Snippet

1. Open **Settings** from the three-dot menu in the drawer
2. Go to the **Snippets** tab
3. Click **Add Snippet**
4. Fill in the fields:
   - **Name** — a label for your reference (e.g., "Email address")
   - **Trigger** — the shortcut you'll type (e.g., `;;email`)
   - **Content** — the text it expands into

## How Triggers Work

Superclip monitors your keystrokes globally. When it detects a trigger sequence, it replaces it with the snippet content. Triggers work in any app — text editors, browsers, terminals, chat apps.

A few tips for choosing triggers:

- **Use a prefix** like `;;` or `//` to avoid accidental expansions
- **Keep triggers short** but memorable
- **Avoid common words** that you'd type normally

## Managing Snippets

- **Enable/disable** — toggle individual snippets on or off without deleting them
- **Edit** — select a snippet from the sidebar to update its name, trigger, or content
- **Delete** — remove snippets you no longer need

## Examples

| Trigger | Expands To |
|---|---|
| `;;email` | `you@example.com` |
| `;;addr` | `123 Main Street, City, State 12345` |
| `;;sig` | `Best regards,\nYour Name\nYour Title` |
| `;;date` | Today's date |
| `;;zoom` | Your recurring Zoom link |

Snippets are persisted across launches and stored locally on your Mac.
