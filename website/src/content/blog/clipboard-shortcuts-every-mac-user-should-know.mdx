You probably use `Cmd+C` and `Cmd+V` dozens of times a day. But macOS has more clipboard power than most people realize — especially if you pair it with the right tools.

Here are 10 clipboard shortcuts and techniques that will make you faster.

## 1. Copy and paste (the basics)

Let's start with what everyone knows:

- **`Cmd+C`** — Copy
- **`Cmd+V`** — Paste
- **`Cmd+X`** — Cut (works in text, and in Finder for files with `Cmd+Option+V` to move)

If this is all you're using, you're leaving a lot on the table.

## 2. Paste without formatting

One of the most underrated shortcuts in macOS:

**`Cmd+Shift+V`** — Paste and Match Style

This strips all formatting from whatever you copied and pastes it as plain text matching the destination's style. No more pasting bold, colored, 24pt text from a website into your document.

Some apps use `Cmd+Option+Shift+V` instead. Superclip normalizes this — you can always paste as plain text from the context menu.

## 3. Undo and redo

You probably know `Cmd+Z` for undo, but:

- **`Cmd+Z`** — Undo
- **`Cmd+Shift+Z`** — Redo

This works everywhere, including after a paste. Pasted the wrong thing? `Cmd+Z` to undo it immediately.

## 4. Select all before copying

- **`Cmd+A`** — Select All

Simple, but people forget it. In a text field, document, or code editor, `Cmd+A` selects everything so you can copy the full content in one shot.

## 5. Clipboard history with Superclip

Here's where it gets interesting. macOS only keeps the last thing you copied. With Superclip:

**`Cmd+Shift+A`** — Open [clipboard history](/docs/clipboard-history)

This brings up your last 100 copied items. Search through them, click to copy, or use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select. You'll never lose a clip again.

## 6. Copy from screenshots with OCR

Copied a screenshot that has text in it? With Superclip's [built-in OCR](/docs/ocr):

1. Take a screenshot (`Cmd+Shift+4`)
2. Open Superclip (`Cmd+Shift+A`)
3. Select the screenshot
4. Click the OCR button to extract the text

No need for a separate OCR app. The text is extracted using Apple's Vision framework, so it's fast and accurate.

## 7. [Paste stack](/docs/paste-stack) for sequential pasting

This is one of Superclip's most powerful features:

**`Cmd+Shift+C`** — Copy and add to paste stack

Copy multiple items into a stack, then paste them in order with `Cmd+V`. The stack auto-advances after each paste. Perfect for:

- Filling out forms with multiple fields
- Migrating data between apps
- Pasting a series of code snippets

## 8. Pin frequently-used clips

Stop re-copying the same things. In Superclip, pin any clip to a [pinboard](/docs/pinboards):

- Your email address
- Shipping address
- Code snippets you use daily
- Canned responses

Pinned clips persist across app restarts and are always one shortcut away.

## 9. Delete sensitive clips

If you copied a password or sensitive info:

- In Superclip, select the item and press **Delete** or **Backspace** to remove it from history
- **`Cmd+Z`** within 30 seconds to undo the deletion if it was accidental
- You can also [exclude specific apps](/docs/privacy-and-settings) (like 1Password) from clipboard monitoring entirely

## 10. [Keyboard-first navigation](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts)

Superclip is built for keyboard power users:

- **Arrow keys** — Navigate through history
- **Enter** — Copy selected item
- **Space** — Preview the item
- **Esc** — Close or clear search
- **Type anything** — Instantly search your history
- **`Cmd+Arrow keys`** — Switch between pinboards

You never need to touch the mouse.
