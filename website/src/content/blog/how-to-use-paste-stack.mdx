You have five fields to fill in. The data is in another app. So you switch to the source, copy field one, switch back, paste, switch to the source, copy field two, switch back, paste — and repeat until you want to throw your keyboard out the window.

Paste stack fixes this. Copy everything first, then paste it in order.

## What is paste stack?

Paste stack is a feature in Superclip that lets you queue up multiple clipboard items and [paste them sequentially](/docs/paste-stack). Each time you press `Cmd+V`, it pastes the current item and automatically advances to the next one.

Think of it like a stack of sticky notes. You write five things down, then peel them off one at a time.

## How it works

### Step 1: Add items to the stack

Use **`Cmd+Shift+C`** to copy an item and add it to your paste stack. Do this for each piece of data you need:

1. Select the first piece of text → `Cmd+Shift+C`
2. Select the second → `Cmd+Shift+C`
3. Select the third → `Cmd+Shift+C`

Each item is added to the stack in order. You can see the stack in the Superclip panel.

### Step 2: Paste in sequence

Now switch to your destination app. Press **`Cmd+V`** to paste the first item. The stack auto-advances — the next `Cmd+V` will paste the second item, and so on.

No switching between apps. No re-copying. Just paste, tab to the next field, paste again.

### Step 3: Done

When the stack is empty, `Cmd+V` goes back to normal clipboard behavior. The session is complete.

## Real-world examples

### Filling out web forms

You have a spreadsheet with name, email, phone, and address. Copy each field with `Cmd+Shift+C`, then tab through the form pasting each one. Four fields, four pastes, done.

### Migrating data between apps

Moving customer records from one CRM to another? Copy all fields from the source record into the paste stack, then paste them into the destination. No back-and-forth.

### Writing code

Need to paste a series of import statements, variable names, or config values? Add them all to the stack, then paste them where they need to go. Especially useful when refactoring.

### Composing emails

Pull together a name, a project title, a deadline, and a link from different sources. Stack them up, then paste them into your email template in order.

### Data entry

If you're entering the same set of values repeatedly — batch numbers, serial codes, addresses — paste stack turns a tedious process into a quick sequence.

## Tips for getting the most out of paste stack

**Preview before pasting.** Press **Space** in Superclip to preview the current stack item before pasting. Make sure it's what you expect. See all available [keyboard shortcuts](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts).

**Remove items from the stack.** If you added something by mistake, select it in the stack view and press **Delete** to remove it without disrupting the order.

**Combine with search.** You can search your [clipboard history](/docs/clipboard-history) to find items to add to the stack. Type to search, then `Cmd+Shift+C` to add matching items.

**Use with [pinboards](/docs/pinboards).** If you frequently paste the same set of items (like an address block), pin them to a pinboard. Then add them to a paste stack when needed.

## Paste stack vs. regular clipboard

| Action | Regular clipboard | Paste stack |
|---|---|---|
| Copy 5 items | Overwrites each time — only keeps the last | Queues all 5 in order |
| Paste | Always pastes the same item | Pastes next item in sequence |
| Multi-app workflow | Constant switching | Copy all first, paste all after |
| Forms & data entry | Slow, error-prone | Fast, sequential |

## Getting started

Paste stack is built into Superclip. There's nothing to configure — just start using `Cmd+Shift+C` to add items and `Cmd+V` to paste them in order.
