If you take a lot of screenshots on macOS, you've probably heard of **CleanShot X**. It's the gold standard for screen capture — screenshots, screen recording, scrolling capture, annotation, and more.

It's also not cheap. A one-time license is $29, and the subscription (which includes cloud storage and updates) is $8/month or $96/year. For a screenshot tool.

We think screen capture should be a feature, not a product. That's why we're building it into Superclip — for free.

## What CleanShot X costs

Let's be clear about the pricing:

- **One-time purchase:** $29 (includes 1 year of updates)
- **Subscription:** $8/month ($96/year) for ongoing updates + cloud storage
- **After year one (one-time license):** $19 to extend updates for another year

If you bought CleanShot X and want to keep it updated, you're looking at roughly $19–96/year depending on your plan. That's on top of whatever you pay for a clipboard manager.

## What we're building

Superclip is a clipboard manager first. But clipboard and screenshots are deeply connected — you capture something, you copy it, you paste it. Splitting them into separate apps never made sense to us.

Here's what our [screen capture features](/docs/screen-capture) will include:

### Area and window capture

Capture any region of your screen or a specific window. Standard stuff, but done natively with SwiftUI so it's fast and integrates with the rest of Superclip.

### Annotation and editing

Mark up your screenshots with arrows, text, shapes, and highlights. Blur sensitive information. Crop and resize. All built into a native editor — no need to open Preview or Pixelmator.

### Scrolling capture

Capture an entire webpage or long document, even the parts that aren't visible on screen. This is one of CleanShot X's most popular features, and we're bringing it to Superclip.

### GIF and MP4 recording

Record your screen as a GIF or MP4. Set the frame rate, crop the recording area, and trim the result. Perfect for bug reports, demos, and documentation.

### Clipboard integration

Every capture automatically appears in your [Superclip history](/docs/clipboard-history). Copy, pin, edit, or paste any screenshot without switching apps. Extract text from screenshots with [built-in OCR](/docs/ocr).

## Why we're bundling it for free

A clipboard manager and a screen capture tool serve the same user: someone who works fast and moves content between apps constantly. Charging separately for each doesn't make sense.

Our pricing model is simple:

- **Free** for the first 1,000 users — including screen capture
- **$14.99/year** after that — still including screen capture

Compare that to paying $14.99/year for Superclip's clipboard features alone, plus $29–96/year for CleanShot X. You're saving anywhere from $29 to $96 per year.

## Timeline

[Clipboard history](/docs/clipboard-history), [pinboards](/docs/pinboards), [paste stack](/docs/paste-stack), and [OCR](/docs/ocr) are already built and shipping. Screen capture features are next on the roadmap:

- **Area and window capture** — coming first
- **Annotation editor** — alongside capture
- **GIF and MP4 recording** — shortly after
- **Scrolling capture** — later in the roadmap

We're building these incrementally. Each feature ships as soon as it's ready — no waiting for a big v2.0 release.

## Who this is for

If you're currently paying for CleanShot X (or thinking about it), Superclip gives you an alternative that bundles screen capture with a full clipboard manager. You get more tools for less money.

If you're using macOS's built-in screenshot tool (`Cmd+Shift+4`) and wish it could do more — annotation, scrolling capture, GIF recording — Superclip will get you there without adding another subscription.

And if you just want a great clipboard manager that happens to include screen capture, [grab a free spot](/#download) while they last.
