- **Quick paste** — open the drawer with `Cmd+Shift+A`, arrow to the item you want, press `Enter` to copy, then `Cmd+V` to paste.
- **Bulk operations** — use `Cmd+Shift+C` to load up a paste stack, then `Cmd+V` repeatedly in the target app.
- **Preview before pasting** — tap `Space` on any item to see a full preview before committing.
