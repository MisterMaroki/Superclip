macOS still ships with a single-slot clipboard. Copy something new, and the old thing is gone. In 2026, that's not acceptable.

A clipboard manager fixes this. It keeps a searchable history of everything you copy, so you can go back to any clip at any time. Some go further — adding pinboards, paste stack, OCR, and more.

Here are the best clipboard managers for Mac right now, with an honest look at what each one does well and where it falls short.

## Quick comparison

| App | Price | History | Pinboards | Paste stack | OCR | Screen capture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Superclip** | $14.99/yr | 100 items | Yes | Yes | Yes | Coming soon |
| **Paste** | $29.99/yr | Unlimited | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Maccy** | Free / $9.99 | Configurable | No | No | No | No |
| **CopyClip 2** | $7.99 | 1,000 items | Lists | No | No | No |
| **Flycut** | Free | 99 items | No | No | No | No |

## 1. Superclip

**Price:** Free for first 1,000 users, then $14.99/year or $1.99/month

Superclip is a native SwiftUI app that combines [clipboard history](/docs/clipboard-history), [pinboards](/docs/pinboards), [paste stack](/docs/paste-stack), and [OCR](/docs/ocr) in one tool. It's designed to be [keyboard-first](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts) — open with `Cmd+Shift+A`, navigate with arrow keys, search by typing.

**What's good:**
- Native performance — launches in under 0.3 seconds, uses less than 30MB RAM
- Built-in OCR for extracting text from images
- Paste stack for sequential pasting (copy five things, paste them in order)
- Smart pinboards for frequently-used clips
- [Privacy-first](/docs/privacy-and-settings): everything stays on your Mac
- Half the price of Paste

**What's missing:**
- History capped at 100 items (enough for most people, but not unlimited)
- No iCloud sync or iOS app yet (both are on the roadmap)
- [Screen capture](/docs/screen-capture) features are still in development

**Best for:** Mac users who want a complete clipboard toolkit — history, paste stack, OCR — at a fair price.

## 2. Paste

**Price:** $29.99/year (via Setapp or direct)

**What's good:**
- Unlimited clipboard history
- iCloud sync between Mac, iPad, and iPhone
- Clean visual UI with thumbnail previews
- Integrates with Setapp subscription

**What's missing:**
- No paste stack
- No built-in OCR
- No screen capture
- Expensive at $29.99/year for what is essentially clipboard history + pinboards

**Best for:** Users who need cross-device sync between Mac and iOS, or Setapp subscribers.

## 3. Maccy

**Price:** Free (open source) or $9.99 on the App Store

Maccy is a lightweight, open-source clipboard manager. It sits in your menu bar and gives you searchable clipboard history with minimal footprint.

**What's good:**
- Free and open source
- Extremely lightweight
- Fast search with fuzzy matching
- Simple, no-nonsense UI

**What's missing:**
- No pinboards or favorites
- No paste stack
- No OCR
- No image or file preview
- Basic feature set — it's just history and search

**Best for:** Developers and minimalists who want clipboard history and nothing else. If you want free and simple, Maccy is hard to beat.

## 4. CopyClip 2

**Price:** $7.99 (one-time)

CopyClip 2 is a menu-bar clipboard manager with up to 1,000 items in history and organizational lists.

**What's good:**
- One-time purchase (no subscription)
- Up to 1,000 items in history
- Organizational lists for grouping clips
- Drag and drop support

**What's missing:**
- No paste stack
- No OCR

## 5. Flycut

**Price:** Free (open source)

Flycut is a simple, open-source clipboard manager based on Jumpcut. It stores your last 99 clips and lets you cycle through them with a keyboard shortcut.

**What's good:**
- Completely free
- Open source
- Minimal resource usage
- Simple keyboard cycling through history

**What's missing:**
- No search
- No pinboards
- No image or file support — text only
- No paste stack or OCR
- Limited to 99 items
- UI is very basic

**Best for:** Users who want the absolute simplest clipboard history with zero configuration.

## So which one should you pick?

**If you want the most features for the price:** Superclip gives you clipboard history, paste stack, OCR, and pinboards for $14.99/year (or free if you're one of the first 1,000 users). It's the best value.

**If you need cross-device sync:** Paste is the only option with iCloud sync and an iOS app. You pay more, but you get clipboard continuity across all your Apple devices.

**If you want free and simple:** Maccy is excellent for just clipboard history. Flycut is even simpler but more limited.

**If you want a one-time purchase:** CopyClip 2 at $7.99 is the way to go, though you'll miss out on newer features like paste stack and OCR.
