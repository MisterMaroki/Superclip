## Open Clipboard History

Press `Cmd+Shift+A` to open the Superclip drawer at the bottom of your screen. This shows everything you've copied, with the most recent item at the top.

You can also click the Superclip icon in the menu bar.

## Copy and Paste

Superclip works alongside your normal clipboard:

- **Copy** — `Cmd+C` copies to your clipboard as usual. Superclip automatically captures it.
- **Paste** — Click any item in the history to copy it back to your clipboard, then `Cmd+V` to paste.

## Search Your History

With the drawer open, just start typing to search. Superclip filters your history in real-time by content. Press `Esc` to clear the search and return to the full list.

## Navigate with Keyboard

Superclip is built for keyboard-first workflows:

- **Arrow keys** — move through clipboard items
- **Enter** — select and copy the highlighted item
- **Space** — preview the selected item
- **Backspace** — delete the selected item
- **Esc** — close the drawer

## Close the Drawer

Press `Esc` or click anywhere outside the drawer to close it. Your clipboard history stays in memory until you quit the app.
