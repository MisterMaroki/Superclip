## What Is OCR?

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) lets you extract readable text from images and screenshots. Superclip uses Apple's built-in **Vision framework** for fast, accurate, on-device text recognition.

## How to Use It

1. Copy an image or take a screenshot — it appears in your clipboard history
2. Select the image in the Superclip drawer
3. Click the **OCR** action or choose **Extract Text** from the context menu
4. The extracted text is displayed and ready to copy

## What It Works On

- Screenshots of web pages, documents, or presentations
- Photos of text, signs, or labels
- Any image with readable text

OCR works best with clear, high-contrast text. Handwritten text may have lower accuracy.

## Actions After Extraction

Once text is extracted, you can:

- **Copy** — copy the extracted text to your clipboard
- **Open in editor** — edit the text in Superclip's rich text editor before copying

## Privacy

All OCR processing happens **locally on your Mac** using Apple's Vision framework. No images or text are sent to any server.
