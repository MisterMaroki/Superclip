## What Are Pinboards?

Pinboards let you save clipboard items you want to keep permanently. Unlike clipboard history (which is capped at 100 items and clears on quit), pinned items persist across app launches.

Think of them as bookmarks for your clipboard.

## Pinning Items

To pin an item from your clipboard history:

1. Select an item in the drawer
2. Right-click and choose **Pin**, or use the pin action in the context menu

Pinned items are marked with an indicator so you can spot them in your history.

## Navigating Pinboards

Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between your pinboards:

- `Cmd+Left Arrow` / `Cmd+Right Arrow` — switch between pinboards
- Arrow keys — navigate within a pinboard

## Unpinning Items

To remove an item from your pinboards, select it and choose **Unpin** from the context menu.

## Persistence

Pinned items are saved locally on your Mac and persist across app launches. They are not affected by the 100-item history limit or the auto-clear-on-quit setting.
