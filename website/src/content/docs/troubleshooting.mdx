## Accessibility Permissions

**Problem:** Global hotkeys (`Cmd+Shift+A`, etc.) don't work.

**Solution:** Superclip needs Accessibility access to register global shortcuts.

1. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility**
2. Make sure **Superclip** is listed and toggled **on**
3. If it's already on, try toggling it off and back on
4. Restart Superclip after changing permissions

> On macOS Ventura and later, you may need to click the lock icon and authenticate before making changes.

## App Not Appearing

**Problem:** Superclip doesn't show up after launching.

**Solution:** Superclip runs as a **menu bar app** — it won't appear in the Dock. Look for the Superclip icon in your **menu bar** at the top of the screen.

If the icon isn't visible:

- Check if it's hidden behind the notch (on MacBook Pro models)
- Try pressing `Cmd+Shift+A` to open the drawer directly
- Check Activity Monitor to confirm Superclip is running

## Hotkey Conflicts

**Problem:** A Superclip shortcut conflicts with another app.

**Solution:** If another app has claimed the same keyboard shortcut, macOS may not deliver it to Superclip. Common conflicts:

- **`Cmd+Shift+A`** — some apps use this for "Select All" or other actions
- **Third-party hotkey apps** (Alfred, Raycast, BetterTouchTool) may intercept shortcuts

To resolve:

1. Check the other app's settings and remap the conflicting shortcut
2. Quit the conflicting app temporarily to confirm the issue

## Clipboard Not Capturing

**Problem:** Copied items aren't appearing in Superclip history.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure Superclip is running (check the menu bar icon)
2. Check if the source app is in your **Excluded Apps** list (Settings > Excluded Apps)
3. Some apps use private clipboard formats that Superclip can't read — this is rare but possible
4. Restart Superclip if items have stopped appearing

## Migration from Paste

**Problem:** Moving from Paste app to Superclip.

**Solution:** Superclip uses the same keyboard shortcut patterns as Paste, so your muscle memory transfers directly. There's no data import needed — Superclip will start capturing your clipboard from the moment you install it.

Key differences:

- Superclip opens with `Cmd+Shift+A` (Paste uses `Cmd+Shift+V` by default)
- Pinboard navigation uses `Cmd+Arrow` keys in both apps
- Paste stack works similarly in both apps

## FAQ

**Q: Does Superclip work with universal clipboard (Handoff)?**
A: Yes. If you copy on your iPhone and it arrives on your Mac's clipboard, Superclip will capture it.

**Q: Can I use Superclip alongside other clipboard managers?**
A: Yes, but it's not recommended. Running two clipboard managers may cause conflicts with hotkeys and clipboard monitoring.

**Q: Where is my clipboard data stored?**
A: Everything is stored in memory while Superclip is running. Pinned items are saved to a local file on your Mac. No data is sent externally.

**Q: How do I completely uninstall Superclip?**
A: Drag Superclip from Applications to the Trash. To remove preferences, delete `~/Library/Preferences/com.superclip.app.plist` and `~/Library/Application Support/Superclip/`.
