## What Are Quick Actions?

Superclip analyzes your clipboard content and surfaces relevant actions in the preview panel. Copy a hex color and you can convert it to RGB. Copy JSON and you can pretty print it. No extra tools needed.

## Supported Content Types

### Colors

Detected formats: hex (`#3b82f6`), RGB (`rgb(59, 130, 246)`), and HSL (`hsl(217, 91%, 60%)`).

**Actions:**
- Copy as Hex
- Copy as RGB
- Copy as HSL

A color swatch is displayed alongside the detected value. Color items also show a tint of the parsed color on their card in the history.

### JSON

Detected when content starts with `{` or `[` and is valid JSON.

**Actions:**
- Pretty Print — reformats with indentation
- Minify — compresses to a single line

### Email Addresses

Detected via standard email patterns.

**Actions:**
- Compose in Mail — opens a new email
- Copy address

### Phone Numbers

Detected via common phone number formats.

**Actions:**
- Call — opens the dialer
- Copy number

### Code

Detected via syntax heuristics (multi-line structured text with code patterns).

**Actions:**
- Copy code

### File Paths

Detected Unix-style paths starting with `/` or `~`.

**Actions:**
- Reveal in Finder
- Copy path

## Where Quick Actions Appear

Quick actions are shown in two places:

1. **Preview panel** — the Quick Actions bar appears below the content preview when actions are available
2. **Context menu** — right-click a card to see available quick actions

## Smart Filters

Superclip also auto-tags items using these same detection heuristics. The filter bar at the top of the drawer lets you narrow your history by content type: Links, Images, Files, Code, Colors, Emails, JSON, and Phones.
