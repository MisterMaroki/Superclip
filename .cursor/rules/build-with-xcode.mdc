# Auto-Rebuild and Run After Changes

After making any code changes to Swift files, stop the current app, rebuild, and launch:

```bash
pkill -x Superclip 2>/dev/null; xcodebuild -project Superclip.xcodeproj -scheme Superclip -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build build 2>&1 | tail -30 && open build/Build/Products/Debug/Superclip.app
```

This:
1. Kills the running Superclip app (if any)
2. Builds the project with xcodebuild
3. Launches the newly built app
