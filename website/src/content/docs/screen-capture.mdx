> **Coming Soon** — Screen capture and recording features are currently in development and will be available in a future update.

## Planned Features

### Area & Window Capture

Capture a specific area of your screen or an entire window with a single shortcut. Captures are saved to your clipboard history automatically.

### Annotation Tools

Mark up your captures with arrows, shapes, text, and highlights before saving or sharing. No need for a separate screenshot tool.

### GIF & MP4 Recording

Record a portion of your screen as a GIF or MP4 video. Ideal for quick demos, bug reports, or sharing workflows.

### Scrolling Capture

Capture an entire scrollable page — web pages, long documents, or chat threads — in a single image.

## Why Built-In?

Most clipboard managers require a separate tool like CleanShot X ($29/yr) for screen capture. Superclip includes capture and recording at no extra cost, so you have one fewer app to install and one fewer subscription to manage.
